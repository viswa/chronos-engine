# Usage
Usage of this api should follow something close to what's described below
1. Check for existing timetables by [/exists](http://localhost:8000/exists) path.
2. If so, user can fetch timetables from a zero-indexed array
3. The timetables are session based, so stopping the server wipes any last remaining.
4. Create a timetable by [/create](http://localhost:8000/create)
5. Retrieve a timetable in JSON by [/timetables/{index}](http://localhost:8000/timetable/0)

# Warning
There's been a new change in JSON response for classes that are split for classes.
